									<h2>As A:<br />
									Software Engineer</h2>
									<p>In August 2022, I made a decision to quit my job as a service coordinator to pursue a more fulfilling career. My inspiration came from my brother, an programmer turned product manager, who was alawys eager to show me the projects he was working on. Intrigued by his work, I decided to join App Academy, a rigorous programming boot camp that known for it's fast pace and dense curriculuim. As a newcomer to programming, I was initially nervous. However, my first experience typing "hello world" was thrilling. I just made something come to life.<br/><br/>
										
										I decided paid the full tuition upfront, knowing that if I failed two tests I would be expelled with no refund. This was because I knew that this boot camp was my chance to become something great. To my surprise, being in a boot camp was one of the happiest times of my life. I was surrounded by motivated students who supported each other constantly, and I learned as much from them as I did from our instructors. Over the course of the program, we learned about Ruby, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, and React, culminating in our creation of a full-stack project. The day of the full-stack presentation was the most rewarding day for me. It was a day when I felt that months of hard work had paid off.<br/><br/>
										
										My next goal is to make a project implementing AI technology and work on my data structures and algorithms questions on LeetCode. I feel like I have set sail on a small boat into the vast ocean, excited and scared at the same time, but I know one day I'll able to share storeis about the places I explored and the spaces I've been.</p>
