										<h3>Service coordinator, 2021-2022</h3>
										<p>Joy Agency</p>
									</header>
									<p>In my role as a Service Coordinator for children aged 0-3 with developmental issues, I helped families navigate the early intervention system and ensure their children received the necessary support. I worked directly with families to assess their child's developmental needs, create Individualized Family Service Plans (IFSPs), and coordinate services with early intervention providers. Additionally, I provided ongoing support and guidance to families throughout the service delivery process, collaborated with early intervention providers, medical professionals, and community organizations, monitored progress towards IFSP goals, and maintained accurate records in compliance with state and federal regulations. My work played a critical role in helping children achieve their developmental milestones and provided families with the resources they needed to support their child's growth and development.</p>

										<h3>Direct Sales Representative, 2021</h3>
										<p>Spectrum</p>
									</header>
									<p>As a Direct Sales Representative for Spectrum, I honed my sales skills by approaching strangers door to door to sell internet, phone, and TV cable services. Despite initial resistance, I found success through effective communication and relationship-building. Listening to customers' needs and finding common ground helped me establish rapport and close more sales. I also learned the importance of persistence and resilience in the face of rejection, using each experience as a learning opportunity. Overall, my time at Spectrum was a rewarding learning experience that taught me valuable skills still in use today.</p>

										<h3>Psychology B.A. Student, 2015-2017 / 2019-2021</h3>
										<p>Stony Brook University</p>
									</header>
									<p>In the first half of my college, I learned that I can't take back the time I lost. Then I took a year off college to learn about taking responsiblity for myself. In my second half of college, I learned that I can make good changes when I put in the effort.</p>

										<h3>Cast Member/Server, 2017-2018</h3>
										<p>Hong Kong Disneyland</p>
									</header>
									<p>As a server at Hong Kong Disneyland, I gained work experience and pursued my education by taking online classes during a year off from school. The job gave me a unique look behind the scenes of the magical world of Disney and allowed me to meet people from all over the world. I took pride in ensuring that guests had a memorable dining experience, which required strong communication skills, attention to detail, and a positive attitude. My time at Hong Kong Disneyland taught me valuable skills in customer service and helped me grow both personally and professionally. I made many new friends and broadened my perspective through serving people from diverse cultural backgrounds.

										<h3>High School Student, 2011-2015</h3>
										<p>Church Farm School</p>
									</header>
									<p>I learned about most of my American culture here. It's a boarding school so I was able to build a brotherhood with students of different background and races. I'm grateful that I get to experience an American high school life.</p>
