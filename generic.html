								<p>As a full-stack software engineer who has recently embarked on my learning journey, I am excited to bring my passion for coding and eagerness to learn to the industry. With a focus on developing web applications, I have gained experience in a range of technologies including React, Redux, Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Express.js, and Node.js. <br/><br/>

									Originally from Hong Kong and now living in America, I bring a unique perspective to the software engineering field with a deep understanding of the cultures of both countries. I am fluent in Cantonese, English, and Mandarin, which has allowed me to effectively communicate with people from different backgrounds and work collaboratively in diverse teams.<br/><br/>
									
									Through my learning journey, I have had the opportunity to work on a number of projects that have given me valuable experience in the full-stack development process. These projects have included building simple web pages, developing complex enterprise applications, and designing efficient databases.<br/><br/>
									
									One of my recent accomplishments was creating full-stack projects using Ruby on Rails with React and Redux, as well as MongoDB with React and Redux. These projects have allowed me to showcase my skills in full-stack development, including database design, server-side scripting, and front-end implementation. I am also familiar with AWS S3 for storing and retrieving files for web applications.<br/><br/>
									
									As a software engineer, I am committed to delivering high-quality applications that meet the needs of businesses and end-users alike. I believe that software engineering is not just about writing code, but about solving problems and delivering value to users. I am always focused on the end-users and strive to provide them with the best possible experience.<br/><br/>
									
									In addition to my technical skills, I am a team player who enjoys collaborating with other developers, designers, and stakeholders to deliver high-quality applications. I am open to feedback and eager to learn from my peers to improve my skills and contribute to the success of the team.<br/><br/>
									
									If you are looking for a motivated and skilled full-stack software engineer who brings a unique perspective to the industry, please don't hesitate to get in touch. I look forward to connecting with you!</p>
